When considering solceller for your home or business, the first question often is: How does the weather affect my solar potential? It’s a great question—especially for those living in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, or even parts of the USA, where the sun and clouds often play hide-and-seek. Understanding the relationship between weather and solcelleanlæg is key to making an informed and confident investment.

## It’s Not Just About Sunny Days

Many believe that solceller only work well in locations drenched in sunshine. In reality, modern solcelleanlæg are designed to perform efficiently in a range of weather conditions—including cloudy, cool, and even snowy climates. Here’s why:

- **Diffuse Light:** Even on cloudy days, solar panels capture diffused sunlight. Your solcelle pris and expected savings are calculated with real weather data, so you get realistic estimates.
- **Cooler Temperatures:** Solceller actually work more efficiently in cooler temperatures—common in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Excessive heat can reduce output, so northern climates have an edge!
- **Snow Reflection:** While heavy snow can temporarily cover panels, light snow often reflects sunlight and can boost performance. Plus, panels are typically installed at an angle to encourage snow to slide off.
