Have you ever wondered how the weather actually affects your solar panels and the savings you can expect? If you’re considering *solceller* for your home or business, understanding the connection between weather patterns and solar energy can help you make a smarter investment. At EcoRay, we offer *transparent calculations*, realistic savings, and *AI-based* system recommendations, so you always know exactly how sunshine—and even clouds—can work in your favor.

## Sunshine, Clouds, and Your Solar Savings

It’s no secret that *solcelleanlæg* perform best under clear skies, but did you know modern panels are surprisingly efficient even on cloudy days?

### Here’s how weather influences your solar journey:

- **Sunny Days:** Maximum energy production. Great for boosting your savings and feeding power back to the grid.
- **Cloudy or Overcast:** Panels capture diffused sunlight, still producing up to 80% of their rated output.
- **Snow:** Light snow can reflect additional sunlight, but heavy snow should be cleared for optimum performance. Modern *solceller til hus* are built to withstand northern winters.
- **Rain:** Cleans your panels, ensuring they perform at peak efficiency once the sun returns.
