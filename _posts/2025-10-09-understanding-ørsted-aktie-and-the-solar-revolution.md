When people in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the USA think of renewable energy investments, ørsted aktie often comes up as a major player. But while green stocks are catching attention, more homeowners and businesses are exploring another powerful way to join the energy transition: installing solceller (solar cells) at home or at work.

## Why ørsted aktie Is in the Spotlight
