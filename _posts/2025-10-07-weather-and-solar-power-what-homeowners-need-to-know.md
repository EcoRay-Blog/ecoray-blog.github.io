Thinking about installing solceller on your home or business? If you’re in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, or the USA, you’ve probably wondered how local weather patterns affect your solar investment. Will rainy days, snow, or those long northern winters impact your solcelleanlæg’s performance or savings? At EcoRay, we’re your advocate—here to offer clear, transparent calculations and advice, so you can make the best decision for your home, budget, and climate.

## How Weather Impacts Solceller

Solar panels (solceller) work by converting sunlight into electricity. Naturally, the more sunshine, the more energy produced. But that’s only part of the story. Modern solcelleanlæg are designed to be efficient—even when it’s cloudy, rainy, or snowy.

**Key weather factors:**

- **Cloud Cover:** Even on overcast days, solceller generate power from diffuse sunlight. While output is reduced, you’ll still see savings on your electricity bill.
- **Rain:** Good news—rain helps keep your panels clean, washing away dust and debris that can reduce efficiency.
- **Snow:** In Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, snow is common. Solceller are built to withstand snow loads, and a light cover can even reflect extra light onto the panels once it slides off.
- **Temperature:** Contrary to popular belief, solceller work best in cool, sunny conditions. Extreme heat can lower efficiency, so the mild summers of Scandinavia are ideal for performance.
- **Daylight Hours:** In the Nordics, long summer days mean huge production peaks. In winter, output is lower, but with the right solceller med batteri, you store excess power for later use.
