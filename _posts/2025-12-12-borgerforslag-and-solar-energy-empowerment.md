When citizens come together to spark change, powerful things can happen. In Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and even the USA, borgerforslag—citizen proposals—are driving real conversations about the future of energy. But what if you could take that proactive spirit and use it to transform your own home or business? At EcoRay, we believe that everyone should have the tools and transparent information to make the best decision about solceller and renewable energy.

## Why Borgerforslag and Solar Go Hand in Hand

Borgerforslag is all about taking initiative and having a voice in society’s direction. When it comes to choosing solceller (solar panels) for your house or business, you deserve as much influence and clarity. That’s where EcoRay comes in—acting as your advocate at every step, ensuring solcelleanlæg (solar systems) are accessible, understandable, and tailored for you.

With transparent calculations, AI-based solcelle rådgivning (solar advice), and realistic savings estimates, we empower you to make the smartest choice—just like submitting your own borgerforslag.

## The True Economy in Solar

Thinking about solcelle investering (solar investment) but unsure about the numbers? Questions like "hvad koster solceller" (what do solar panels cost) or "how much can I save on my electricity bill?" are natural.
