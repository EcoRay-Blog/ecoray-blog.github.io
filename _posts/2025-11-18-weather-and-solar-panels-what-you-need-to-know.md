When considering solceller for your home or business, one of the first questions that pops up is, “How does the weather affect my solar panels?” It’s a smart question—after all, the climate in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and even certain parts of the USA can be unpredictable. At EcoRay, we believe in transparent calculations and realistic savings estimates, so let’s explore how weather impacts your solcelleanlæg and why modern technology makes solar a fantastic investment, rain or shine.

## Sun, Clouds, and Your Solar System

It’s easy to assume that solar panels only work on bright, sunny days. The truth is, solceller are designed to perform in a wide range of weather conditions:

- **Sunny Days:** Maximum energy production, ideal for both solceller til hus and businesses looking to spar på elregning.
- **Cloudy Weather:** While output dips slightly, panels still generate electricity thanks to diffuse sunlight. Even in overcast climates like Denmark and Norway, you can capture significant solar energy.
- **Rain and Snow:** Rain actually helps keep panels clean, boosting efficiency. Snow typically slides off the panels due to their angle, and cold temperatures can even improve their performance.
