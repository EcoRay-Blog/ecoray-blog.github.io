Have you ever looked out the window during a snestorm and wondered if your solar panels are still doing their job? As winter storms bring heavy snow and icy winds to Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and even parts of the USA, many homeowners and businesses are asking the same question: how do solceller hold up in a snestorm, and what should you consider before installing a solcelleanlæg on your roof?

## How Snestorms Affect Solar Panels in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the USA

Snestorms can bring significant snow accumulation, which may temporarily cover your solceller and limit their electricity production. But the good news is that most modern solcelleanlæg are designed to handle harsh winter conditions. Here’s why:

- **Durable Materials**: High-quality solceller are built to withstand heavy snow loads and icy winds typical of a Scandinavian or North American snestorm.
- **Self-Cleaning**: As panels absorb sunlight, even weak winter rays, they warm up slightly—helping to melt and shed snow faster.
